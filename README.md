# Race Turtle Game

This is a simple turtle race game implemented using the Turtle module in Python. The game allows multiple turtles to race against each other on a graphical interface.

## Setup

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to have the `turtle` module installed, which comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

## How to Run

1. Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Create a new Python file and copy the provided code into it.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `race_game.py`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
6. Run the script by executing the command `python race_game.py`.
7. The game window will appear, showing the turtles lined up at the starting point.

## Gameplay

The game starts with five turtles lined up at the starting point. Each turtle is assigned a different color: red, blue, black, yellow, and white. The turtles are represented graphically using turtle shapes.

The race begins when you run the script. The turtles will start moving forward at random speeds. The first turtle to reach the end of the track wins the race.

## Controls

There are no user controls or inputs required to play the game. The turtles move automatically once the race starts.

## Dependencies

This program relies on the following external library:

- `turtle`: This module provides a powerful set of tools for creating graphics and animations.

If you don't have the `turtle` module installed, you may need to install it before running the script. You can do so by executing the command `pip install turtle` in your terminal or command prompt.
